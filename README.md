# Airline Bookings and Performance Analysis
## Flight Bookings and Sales Performance Analysis 

### 1. Overview:
The Revenue and Net Planning departments provide you with Spain's (fictional) sales and flight data. The dataset includes the performance of all Easter flights in 2019 and in 2023. With the help of your analysis, they want to compare the companyâ€™s sales and flight performance this year vs the pre-Corona status. Based on this comparison, they want you to create actionable insights.

#### Objective:
* What can be done with the data in Power BI? Analyze the provided dataset and provide a dashboard for the stakeholders.
* What key figures can be developed from the dataset?
* Identify interesting trends/outliers/developments and derive actionable insights for the stakeholders.

#### Optional Tasks:
* What additional data from other sources could be included to gain meaningful insights?
* The column for the new route identifier had some issues during the data load. Show us a clever way to fill in the missing data.
* Include ad-hoc analytical scripts in R or Python to gain meaningful insights.


Now we understand the business objectives from the stakeholders, let's start to work on the porject.
